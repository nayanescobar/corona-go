Covid-19 spreading awareness is aimed at the visualization and simulation of how corona virus spreads from person to person while not following protocols 
We have used an interactive graphics method using the keyboard function through which the user can control the flow of the program through menu-driven bitmap function.
The program is extremely user friendly as the only skill required in executing this program is the knowledge of graphics.

Covid-19 spreading awareness is a mini project in computer graphics which is an animation of how an potentially infected person can spread virus to people and also the simple precautions to reduce your chances of being infected or preventing spread of  COVID-19 as Well. we have Created an scenic city view that how can an person avoid chance of getting infected and follow preventive measures from an potentially COVID-19 infectious person. we  can control the movement of the virus .In addition to this we have created background  simple objects of building surrounded ,movement of clouds , sun.
